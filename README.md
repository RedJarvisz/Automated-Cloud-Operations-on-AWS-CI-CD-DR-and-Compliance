# Automated Cloud Operations on AWS: CI/CD, DR, and Compliance

## Overview
This project focuses on automating cloud operations in AWS by integrating:
- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, Docker, and Terraform.
- **Disaster Recovery (DR)** using AWS Backup, S3 Versioning, and cross-region replication.
- **Security Compliance** using AWS Config, AWS Security Hub, and Terraform.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- An **AWS account** with necessary permissions.
- Installed **AWS CLI, Terraform, Docker, and Jenkins** on your local machine or an AWS EC2 instance.
- Configured AWS credentials using `aws configure`.

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### **Phase 1: Environment Setup**
1. Set up **IAM roles and policies** for CI/CD, security compliance, and disaster recovery.
2. Install **Terraform, AWS CLI, Jenkins, and Docker** on an AWS EC2 instance.
3. Configure Terraform for infrastructure automation.

---

### **Phase 2: CI/CD Automation**
#### **1. Set Up a Code Repository**
- Create a GitHub repository for your application code.
- Connect GitHub to AWS CodePipeline.

#### **2. Create a CI/CD Pipeline**
- Define a pipeline with stages:
  - **Source** (GitHub)
  - **Build** (Jenkins + Docker)
  - **Test** (Automated tests using Jest/PyTest)
  - **Deploy** (Deploy to AWS EC2, Lambda, or ECS)

#### **3. Automate Infrastructure with Terraform**
- Write Terraform scripts to provision AWS services (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda).
- Store Terraform state in an **S3 backend** with versioning enabled.

---

### **Phase 3: Disaster Recovery (DR)**
#### **1. Set Up AWS Backup**
- Configure **AWS Backup** to automate snapshots of EC2, RDS, and EBS.
- Define a backup plan and retention policy.

#### **2. Enable S3 Versioning and Cross-Region Replication**
- Enable **S3 Versioning** for critical data storage.
- Configure **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)** for disaster recovery.

#### **3. Implement Failover Strategy**
- Set up an **Auto Scaling Group** with multiple instances across Availability Zones.
- Use **Route 53** for DNS failover to switch traffic during outages.

---

### **Phase 4: Security Compliance Automation**
#### **1. Enable AWS Config for Compliance Monitoring**
- Set up AWS Config to track changes to AWS resources.
- Define AWS Config rules to check for security compliance.

#### **2. Use AWS Security Hub for Security Insights**
- Enable AWS Security Hub to monitor security findings from GuardDuty, IAM, and CloudTrail.
- Set up automated alerts using Amazon SNS and Lambda.

#### **3. Automate Security Policies with Terraform**
- Use Terraform to enforce security policies:
  - Ensure **S3 Buckets are encrypted**
  - Enforce **IAM least privilege access**
  - Restrict **public access to critical resources**

---

### **Phase 5: Testing & Monitoring**
#### **1. Test CI/CD Pipeline**
- Push changes to GitHub and verify if the pipeline runs successfully.
- Check deployment logs in AWS CodePipeline or Jenkins.

#### **2. Simulate Disaster Recovery Scenarios**
- Delete EC2 instances and check if backups restore automatically.
- Failover DNS using Route 53 and confirm traffic shifts correctly.

#### **3. Monitor Security & Compliance**
- Check AWS Config and Security Hub dashboards for non-compliance alerts.
- Verify Terraform security policies are enforced after infrastructure changes.

---

### **Phase 6: Deployment and Documentation**
- Deploy the solution to a **production environment**.
- Document the architecture, security policies, and CI/CD workflows.
- Set up a **dashboard using AWS CloudWatch** for monitoring logs and performance.

---

## **Final Outcome**
By completing this project, you will have a fully automated cloud operation setup that ensures:
✅ **Automated CI/CD deployment** with Jenkins and AWS CodePipeline  
✅ **Disaster recovery readiness** with AWS Backup and S3 Versioning  
✅ **Security compliance enforcement** using AWS Config and Terraform
